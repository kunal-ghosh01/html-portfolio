<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>A beautiful movie on life. The movie carries the motto of chasing excellence in whatever field one might work at.</p>
<h3>Lootera</h3>
<p>Lootera is a classic which is very rarely made in indian cinema. I am using the word classic not only to define the way the film looks the novel adapation is perfectly adapted here and the film itself is made in a novelstic way. The period setup the film itself is so quite and calm which never raises or has ups and downs it is staright through out the emotions are really subtle which every artist has pulled out with top notch perfection i was surprised seeing ranveer underplaying this much no doubt he is what he wants when it is characters but here he is never him even for a second sonakshi is just an angel in the film her presence feels so pure this is exactly what i felt watching.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
